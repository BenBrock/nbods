This is an n-body simulation created during HackPrinceton.  N-body simulations
are simulations of systems of particles under the influence of forces, such as
relativistic gravity.  Our simulations display distinct galaxy filaments and halos.

We include naive and Barnes-Hut solutions to the n-body problem, and have computed
and rendered simulations of systems of 10,000 and 100,000 particles.
